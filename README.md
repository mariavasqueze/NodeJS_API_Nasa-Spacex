# Node.js SpaceX API Mission Tracker

I connected the SpaceX API with a NASA mission control front-end to show
all launches filtering the information to show which missions have been
completed or aborted. All the data is saved on a MongoDB database. The
user can also create & abort future missions to the Exoplanets from NASAâ€™s
data
